# Retro Newspaper: DaVinci Resolve Fusion Templates
Lately, I wanted to practice using DaVinci Resolve Fusion. Since I love the way the
[Vox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFIdIVngeYA&t=172s) videos are edited, I decided to 
make something similar as a training example and put it into a collection of reusable 
templates. I don't know whether that editing style has a special name, so I called it
"Retro Newspaper", because that is what it reminds me of.

The original Vox fonts are [Harriet Display](https://okaytype.com/typefaces/harriet)
for titles and [Balto](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/balto) for text. The most similar
free and open source fonts I found are [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display)
and [Work Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans?query=work+sans), respectively.

Here is a [demo video](https://youtu.be/Wpnb_xEjAeo) of all elements:
